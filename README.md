## Features

Exasol Notebook Connector (ENC) currently contains a **Secret Store** that can be used in Jupyter notebook applications to store arbitrary credentials and configuration items, such as user names, passwords, URLs, etc.

By that users of such notebook applications
* need to enter their credentials and configuration items only once
* can store them in a secure, encrypted, and persistent file based on SQLite and [coleifer/sqlcipher3](https://github.com/coleifer/sqlcipher3)
* can use these credentials and configuration items in their notebook applications

## Usage

```python
from pathlib import Path
from exasol.secret_store import Secrets

file = "password_db.sqlite"
secrets = Secrets(Path(file), "my secret password")
key = "my key"
secrets.save(key, "my value")
value = secrets.get(key)
```

#### Constraints and Special Situations

* If file does not exist then SecretStore will create it.
* If password is wrong then SecretStore will throw an exception.
* If file contains key from a session in the past then method `secrets.save()` will overwrite the value for this key.
* If key is not contained in file then SecretStore returns `None`.
* Saving multiple keys can be chained: `secrets.save("key-1", "A").save("key-2", "B")`
