How to Release?
***************

Creating a new release of the NC requires 3 steps

1. Prepare the release

2. Merge your pull request to the default branch

3. Trigger the release process

.. code-block:: shell

    poetry run -- nox -s release:prepare -- --type {major,minor,patch}
    poetry run -- nox -s release:trigger

For further information, please refer to section `How to Release
<https://exasol.github.io/python-toolbox/main/user_guide/features/creating_a_release.html>`_
in the PTB's User Guide.

Selecting the Versions for SLCT and SLCR
****************************************

NC contains multiple dependencies including the following

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Dependency                                                                              | Defined in                                                     | Example                                               |
+=========================================================================================+================================================================+=======================================================+
| ``script-languages-container-tool`` (SLCT)                                              | File `pyproject.toml <slct_dep_>`_                             | ``exasol-script-languages-container-tool = "^1.0.0"`` |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| A release of the Exasol Script Languages Containers ``script-languages-release`` (SLCR) | File `exasol/nb_connector/slct/constants.py <slc_constants_>`_ | ``SLC_RELEASE_TAG = "9.1.0"``                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------+

.. _slct_dep: https://github.com/exasol/notebook-connector/blob/main/pyproject.toml
.. _slc_constants: https://github.com/exasol/notebook-connector/blob/main/exasol/nb_connector/slc/constants.py

Additionally, each version of the SLCR depends on a specific version of the
SLCT, see the SLCR release letters and the file ``pyproject.toml`` used by any
specific released version of the SLCR.

Conclusion: Whenever you update the major version of
``script-languages-container-tool`` in ``pyproject.toml`` you will need to
update the referenced tag of SLCR in ``slct_manager.py``.

Example
=======

For the versions named in the table above

* `SLCR version 9.1.0 <slcr_910_>`_ in the release letter, section
  "_Script-Language-Container-Tool (Exaslct)_" states "_This release uses
  version 1.0.0 of the container tool._"

* When clicking on the commit `60492ad <slc_commit_>`_ and "Browse files", then
  SLCR's file `pyproject.toml <slc_pyproject_>`_ shows
  ``exasol-script-languages-container-tool = "^1.0.0"``

.. _slcr_910: https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release/releases/tag/9.1.0
.. _slc_commit: https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release/commit/abd3c4b3fff220215ddd75ff98284e6076d44671#diff-50c86b7ed8ac2cf95bd48334961bf0530cdc77b5a56f852c5c61b89d735fd711R28
.. _slc_pyproject: https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release/blob/60492ade8679948ddbaddee47596c04b16959344/pyproject.toml#L28

In this case, the dependencies shown in the table above, are âœ… **valid** as
NC's file ``pyproject.toml`` depends on the same major version of SLCT.

General instructions
====================

Check if the referred version of SLCR is also compatible with the version of SLCT:

1. Go to `SLCR releases
   <https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release/releases>`_.

2. Search for the SLCR version referenced in NC's file
   ``exasol/nb_connector/slc/constants.py``.

3. Check if in the SLCR release, file ``pyproject.toml``, dependency
   ``script-languages-container-tools`` has the same major version.

Impact on NC Tests
==================

Some of the tests of the Notebook Connector, especially the integration tests,
may depend on particular properties of a particular SLCR release, e.g. a
particular flavor to be present.

In consequence, updating the SLCR version potentially may require updating the
NC tests as well, e.g. the name of the flavor used in the tests.


UI Testing Setup
================

To run UI tests using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and Pytest, follow these steps to ensure all dependencies are installed and snapshots are updated correctly.

1. **Install Playwright browser binaries**

   This command installs the required browser (Chromium) for Playwright:

   .. code-block:: bash

      playwright install chromium

2. **Install system dependencies for Playwright**

   This is necessary especially on Linux systems to ensure all required libraries are available:

   .. code-block:: bash

      playwright install-deps

3. **Run UI tests and update Solara snapshots**

   Use the following command to run UI tests and update the reference snapshots used for visual comparison:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pytest tests/ui/*.py --solara-update-snapshots

   This will overwrite existing snapshots with new ones generated during the test.
