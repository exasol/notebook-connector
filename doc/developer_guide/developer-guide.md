## How to Release?

Creating a new release of the NC requires 3 steps

1. Prepare the release
2. Merge your pull request to the default branch
3. Trigger the release process

```shell
poetry run -- nox -s release:prepare -- --type {major,minor,patch} <additional-options>
poetry run -- nox -s release:trigger
```

For further information, please refer to section [How to Release](https://exasol.github.io/python-toolbox/main/user_guide/how_to_release.html) in the PTB's User Guide.

## Selecting the Versions for SLCT and SLCR

NC contains multiple dependencies including the following

| Dependency | Defined in | Example |
|------------|------------|---------|
| `script-languages-container-tool` (SLCT) | File [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/exasol/notebook-connector/blob/main/pyproject.toml) | `exasol-script-languages-container-tool = "^1.0.0"` |
| A release of the Exasol Script Language Containers `script-languages-release` (SLCR) | File [exasol/nb_connector/slct_manager.py](https://github.com/exasol/notebook-connector/blob/main/exasol/nb_connector/slct_manager.py) | `SLC_RELEASE_TAG = "9.1.0"` |

Additionally, each version of the SLCR depends on a specific version of the SLCT, see the SLCR release letters and the file `pyproject.toml` used by any specific released version of the SLCR.

Conclusion: Whenever you update the major version of `script-languages-container-tool` in `pyproject.toml` you will need to update the referenced tag of SLCR in `slct_manager.py`

### Example

For the versions named in the table above

* [SLCR version 9.1.0](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release/releases/tag/9.1.0) in the release letter, section  "_Script-Language-Container-Tool (Exaslct)_" states "_This release uses version 1.0.0 of the container tool._"
* When clicking on the commit [60492ad](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release/blob/60492ade8679948ddbaddee47596c04b16959344/pyproject.toml#L28) and "Browse files", then SLCR's file [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release/commit/abd3c4b3fff220215ddd75ff98284e6076d44671#diff-50c86b7ed8ac2cf95bd48334961bf0530cdc77b5a56f852c5c61b89d735fd711R28) shows `exasol-script-languages-container-tool = "^1.0.0"`

In this case the dependencies shown in the table above are âœ… **valid** as NC's file `pyproject.toml` depends on the same major version of SLCT.

### General instructions

Check if the referred version of SLCR is also compatible with the version of SLCT:

1. Go to [SLCR releases](https://github.com/exasol/script-languages-release/releases)
2. Search for the SLCR version referenced in NC's file `exasol/nb_connector/slct_manager.py`
3. Check if in the SLCR release, file  `pyproject.toml`, dependency `script-languages-container-tools` has the same major version
